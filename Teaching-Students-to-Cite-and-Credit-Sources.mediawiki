== Introduction ==
The first-year writing course is no longer the realm solely of basic word processor documents comprised of nothing more than words on a page. Instead, students compose essays that include static images that contribute to their documents. They create static projects (like the visual argument poster on the left) that combine images and linguistic text to build their message. They may even compose digital projects that include audio recordings and video clips.

The assets that students use in these compositions may be their own work, but that just as frequently include materials created by others. A student’s project may include video footage from a network news story, audio clips from an independent podcast, and photographs posted on Twitter by first-hand observers. As they create these projects, students must consider the ownership and copyright of the assets, which can be covered by a variety of intellectual property rights protections—from copyright to Creative Commons licenses. They may encounter resources that are in the public domain, that are royalty-free, and that are covered by commercial licenses (e.g., assets that you pay to use).

In this article, I survey current first-year writing handbooks for instruction on using copyrighted and Creative Commons-licensed resources in citation and attribution practices. By examining the discussion of documentation practices for static images, audio recordings, and video clips in these handbooks, I provide further insight into the gaps in the discussion of ownership, authorship, and copyright in student handbooks published in the U.S. I conclude by offering suggestions for how to address the oversight in these handbooks so that students more fully understand how intellectual property rights as they cite and credit sources.

== Some Definitions ==
For the purposes of this article, we need some definitions

When works feature a Creative Commons license, the originator of the work has provided specific guidelines on how that work can be used by others, without violation of copyright or other intellectual property rights.

Multimodal: Following the New London Group

Texts: All kinds of projects that students compose, from word processor-based documents to video and audio recordings.
Documents: Synonymous with Texts.

Word Processor-Based Documents (but what about wiki, webpages, blogs, etc?????)
Slideshows
Videos
Audio Recordings
Images

Performance-based Projects
Analog projects
Digital Projects

Static Texts
Dynamic Texts

''' "Make a prediction about future of ip/copyright/plagiarism" (an open-ended prognostication prompt) '''
Content will become increasingly devalued, while the right to claim profit from moving information will become more important. (As in late capitalism, the greatest profits aren't extracted directly from capital, but from the *movement* of capital on and through various markets.) The ability to filter, abstract, and reconnect information in useful ways will also become more important than the ability to create information (a sort of meta-production/meta-information skill). Arguably, acadmics will be good at this sort of thing because much of what we do involves these very activities. But we tend to fall back on romantic views of the individual which reposition our work in the older economy.

==== Documentation and Citation ====
Most of the handbooks adopted for first-year writing courses focus on the customary curricula of essays and reports written in various genres—from description and narrative to persuasion and argument.  Documented research projects comprise a strong portion of these texts, as they demonstrate how to evaluate potential sources, integrate found materials into drafts, and cite sources used in these documents.

I feel as if I am just bumbling around and saying things that everyone already knows. What is the point of saying these things that anyone who has ever looked at a few handbooks already knows. People know what is in handbooks. They may not have thought about what is NOT in these texts, but they know the basics. Argh.

<img src=https://github.com/tengrrl/KOACSI/raw/master/images/Writer2Writer-usingimages.png />

The primary domain of these handbooks is the print-ready word-processor document. They sometimes mention student-composed webpages and more rarely discuss student-created projects that result in static images, audio recordings, and video. From this perspective, perhaps the authors do not see it as a practical concern to address issues such as how to add an attribution to a persuasive poster or a documentary video.





==== Attribution and Credits ====

Little discussion of attribution and credits in what Writer/Designer refers to as "more overtly multimodal" texts. (p. 8)

=== Identification of Gaps in Current Resources ===

Guessing: Little to no support for how to provide attribution for sources used in heavily-multimodal composing. Privileging of linguistic text sources and text-focused systems of attribution.

Fair use is a legal concept that describes when it is acceptable to use works protected by copyright. Fair use is determined by four principles, which you can read more about in your textbook:

* '''How will the work be used?''' Is it for commentary, education, research, etc.? Will someone profit financially from it?
* '''What kind of work is it?''' In particular, has it been published?
* '''How much of the work will be used?''' All of it? Most of it? A little of it?
* '''How will the use effect the sales of the original?''' Will people still buy/use the original?

Use the flowchart on [http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2014/07/14/can-i-use-that-picture/ Can I Use that Picture? The Terms, Laws, and Ethics for Using Copyrighted Images], from Curtis Newbold, to decide if you your use of a source is fair use.

Use the [http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/ Fair Use Evaluator], from the American Library Association, for a thorough analysis and to write a justification of your use.

Time for an open source guide to citations and attribution that takes the education away from the publishers, who are more invested in copyright ownership than in free and open systems of citation.
