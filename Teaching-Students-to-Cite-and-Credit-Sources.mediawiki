== Introduction ==
The first-year writing course is no longer the realm solely of basic word processor documents comprised of nothing more than words on a page. Instead, students compose essays that include static images that contribute to their documents. They create static projects (like the visual argument poster on the left) that combine images and linguistic text to build their message. They may even compose digital projects that include audio recordings and video clips.

The assets that students use in these compositions may be their own work, but they just as frequently include materials created by others. A student’s research project may include video footage from a network news story, audio clips from an independent podcast, and photographs posted on Twitter by first-hand observers. As they create these projects, students must consider the ownership and copyright of the assets, which can be covered by a variety of intellectual property (IP) rights protections—from copyright to Creative Commons licenses. They may encounter resources that are in the public domain, that are royalty-free, and that are covered by commercial licenses (e.g., assets that you pay to use).

In this article, I survey current first-year writing handbooks for instruction on using copyrighted and Creative Commons-licensed resources in citation and attribution practices. By examining the discussion of documentation practices for static images, audio recordings, and video clips in these handbooks, I provide further insight into the gaps in the discussion of ownership, authorship, and copyright in student handbooks published in the U.S. I conclude by offering suggestions for how to address the oversight in these handbooks so that students more fully understand how IP rights as they cite and credit sources.

== Survey of Current Handbooks ==

For this article, I reviewed ten first-year writing handbooks for the following information:
* documentation of images, audio, and video sources
* coverage of IP rights
* attribution and credits in static and dynamic texts that go beyond word processor-based essays

The review focused on these handbooks (in alphabetical order by title):

I used [https://www.macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/writerdesigner-secondedition-ball ''Writer/Designer'', 2nd ed.] (2018) by Cheryl E. Ball, Jennifer Sheppard, and Kristin L. Arola as a model of a thorough coverage of Creative Commons and of attribution practices in texts that go beyond the word processor-based essays.

To ensure a thorough search of these handbooks and ''Writer/Designer'', I used digital versions of the handbooks obtained through the [https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/ Vital Source Bookshelf] and the related search tools on the Vital Source website. I also reviewed the sections on research, documentation, and plagiarism in all the handbooks and checked specifically for references to the following terms using the search tools:

* Creative Commons
* copyright
* fair use
* public domain
* visuals
* video
* audio

=== Documentation of Images, Audio, and Video Sources ===
Most handbooks adopted for first-year writing courses, including the ten reviewed for this article, focus on the customary curricula of essays and reports written in various genres—from description and narrative to persuasion and argument.  Documented research projects comprise a strong portion of these texts, with sections that demonstrate how to evaluate potential sources, integrate found materials into drafts, and cite sources used in these documents.

Each of the ten handbooks include information on how to write in-text citations and bibliographic entries for static images, audio recordings, and video in  MLA, APA, and Chicago style formats. Nine of the ten also cover the CSE style format, with ''A Writer’s Reference'' as the exception. Additionally, each handbook discusses the research process, covering how to gather and evaluate resources, how to use resources in a research project, and how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism. Finally, each includes a deep cache of examples that demonstrate how these steps in the research process work.

Where these ten handbooks differ is in the ways that they address research projects that include (rather than simply refer to, quote, paraphrase, or summarize) static images, audio recordings, and videos. Those that discuss these resources, emphasize the importance of citing the sources properly. ''Keys for Writers'' explains, “As a general rule, whichever style of documentation you use, you need to identify and label a visual source, such as a figure or a table, where you include it in your paper. Be sure to give credit to the original source of the image” (7e, p. 162).

In its discussion of website projects, the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' states, “Always cite material that you do not generate yourself,” and outlines these specific suggestions: “If your Web text will be public, request permission for use of material not in the public domain unless the site says permission is not needed. Check for a credit in the source, and if the contact information of the creator is not apparent, e-mail the sponsor of the site and ask for it”  (14c-2, p. 251).

''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' also addresses visual sources that are included in word processor-style documents, explaining “When using an image from another source, be sure to cite it correctly. If the image will appear on a public Web site, ask the copyright holder for permission.” (17b-3, p. 298).

There are exceptions to the coverage of documentation of images, audio, and video sources however. ''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'', for example, outlines the following “Information That Requires Documentation,” focusing primarily on “words”:
<blockquote>
* '''Words taken directly from a source.''' If you quote a source, enclose the quotation in quotation marks and include an in-text citation.
* '''Specific ideas, findings, conclusions, and arguments taken from a source, even if you put them in your own words.''' If you put someone else’s ideas in your own words, you are paraphrasing his or her information. If the passage from the source is long and you shorten it and put it in your own words, you are summarizing his or her ideas. In both cases, an in-text citation is needed.
* '''Statistics, figures, and the results of a study.''' Unless you have conducted your own study and created your own set of statistics, you have probably used a source to get this data. Cite the source of the data. (emphasis original, 68b, p. 386)
</blockquote>
Following the advice from this list, a student may surmise that no documentation is needed for borrowed photographs, drawings, video clips, and other resources that go beyond words on a printable page.
=== Coverage of IP Rights ===
In their discussion of the research and composing processes, these handbooks refer to IP rights as part of their explanation of why documentation is necessary. In particular, the textbooks focus on the ownership of resources that students may incorporate in their projects, addressing how to find sources they can use and how to determine when permission is required to use those sources.

In this context, students need details on how copyright and Creative Commons licenses work, what it means for an asset to be in the public domain, and how fair use governs the permission required to use a source. All ten handbooks mention copyright and cover some aspects of IP rights, but only ''Keys for Writers'', ''The Little, Brown Handbook'', and ''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' mention all four IP concepts (copyright, Creative Commons, fair use, and public domain).   Eight of the handbooks include the term fair use, and seven mention public domain. Only half of the handbooks refer to Creative Commons.

The table below shows which of the IP concepts are covered in the ten handbooks. A “Yes” in the table indicates that the topic is mentioned in the handbook.

''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' has the most extensive discussion of IP rights of the ten handbooks. The concepts are introduced in the section on plagiarism:
<blockquote>
Related to plagiarism are the concepts of copyright and intellectual property. '''Copyright''' is the legal right to control the reproduction of an original work—a piece of writing, a musical composition, a play, a movie, a computer program, a photograph, a work of art. A copyrighted work is the '''intellectual property''' of the copyright holder, whether that entity is a publisher, a record company, an entertainment conglomerate, or the individual creator of the work. (emphasis original, 20a, p. 321)
</blockquote>
Following this overview, ''McGraw-Hill'' explains copyright, fair use, and intellectual property in more detail (20a1–3) and includes a highlight box with links to additional information for “Learning More about Plagiarism, Copyright and Fair Use, and Intellectual Property” (p. 325).

''McGraw-Hill’s'' also addresses the use of copyrighted images, audio, and video, outlining the four questions that are used to determine fair use:
<blockquote>
* '''What is the purpose of the use?''' Educational, nonprofit, and personal uses are more likely to be considered fair than commercial use.
* '''What is the nature of the work being used?''' In most cases, imaginative and unpublished materials can be used only if you have the permission of the copyright holder.
* '''What effect would this use have on the market for the original?''' The use of a work is usually considered unfair if it would hurt sales of the original.
* '''How much of the copyrighted work is being used?''' The use of a small portion of a text is more likely to be considered fair than copying a whole work. (20c, p. 325, 327)
</blockquote>
While the text does not identify these questions as related specifically to fair use, the section’s focus “Use copyrighted materials fairly” clearly alludes to the concept.


==== Limitations in Handbook References to IP Concepts ====

By comparison to the full details in the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' and the ''Little, Brown Handbook,'' some of the handbooks include only superficial references to the IP concepts. ''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'', for instance, provides only a definition of the term ''public domain'':  “'''public domain'''—phrase used to refer to works that are not granted or are no longer granted exclusive protection by copyright law” (68b, p. 388). The text includes no further discussion of the term and no examples, leaving students to suss out how the idea of public domain relates to their work.

''The Writer’s Handbook'' includes only a cursory reference to the concept of fair use: “́The ''Chicago Manual'' also gives advice on copyright law, such as how a work is granted copyright, what may constitute copyright violation, and what is fair use” (25a, p. 319). To learn about fair use, the student using the ''Writer’s Handbook'' must presumably search out a copy of the ''Chicago Manual.''


=== Coverage of Creative Commons ===
Five of the handbooks (''The McGraw-Hill Handbook,'' the ''St. Martin’s Handbook,'' the Little, Brown Handbook,'' ''Keys for Writers,'' and ''Writing Matters'') mention the IP concept of Creative Commons specifically, though with differing levels of detail. Of the ten handbooks, the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' explains  Creative Commons in reference to finding images to use in projects:
<blockquote>
The Creative Commons site (<www.creativecommons.org>) lets you search for material with a Creative Commons license. Such a license specifies the permitted uses of the content. The material shown can be reproduced or altered for noncommercial purposes, as long as it is cited. All the images accompanying Wikipedia are licensed through Creative Commons, so that is another source. (17b-2, p. )
</blockquote>
An ideal description of Creative Commons would include all the possible licenses and explain in more specific detail their requirements. For instance, in addition to its noncommercial license, an image may be under an attribution license, which requires identification of the resource’s owner. Perhaps ''McGraw-Hill'' omits these particular details since students must cite all their sources in their work; however, this explanation does not account for the failure to explain Creative Commons’ nonderivative and share-alike licensing.

Even with these shortcomings, the ''McGraw-Hill'' coverage of Creative Commons is more complete than any of other handbooks. In its section on in “Creating audio and video projects,” the ''The St. Martin’s Handbook'' gives readers a short definition, relying on an implicit comparison to licensing options that require permission for use:
<blockquote>
Will you need sound or images from other sources? If so, where can you acquire what you need? If you use the work of others in a project that will be posted for the public, you may need to seek permission from the rightsholders (see Chapter 14). However, critiquing or analyzing someone else’s work in your own project is often considered a “fair use” that does not require permission. You may also want to look for images and sounds distributed under a Creative Commons license, which allows others to use them freely. (18c, p. 290)
</blockquote>
This passage does not fully explain Creative Commons licenses, but it does suggest that the license is a useful option for projects that move beyond word processor-style essays. The Little, Brown Handbook follows a similar strategy, providing few details and sending students to a librarian for more information:
<blockquote>
To avoid having to seek permission [for  visual, audio, and video sources], you can search Web sites such as Google, Flickr Creative Commons, and Wikimedia Commons for media that are not protected by copyright. On Google, for instance, go to “Search tools” and select “Labeled for reuse.” Consult a librarian at your school if you have questions. (42i, p. 575)
</blockquote>
wow i need more here
''Keys for Writers'' gives readers the least information, simply mentioning Creative Commons:
<blockquote>
Keep in mind, however, that unless the creator of the image has explicitly stated that it is free for noncommercial use (either by a statement on the Web site or by using a Creative Commons license), you should assume that the image is copyrighted and not free for the taking.
</blockquote>
Presumably readers of ''Keys for Writers'' will deduce the definition of Creative Commons as a way to indicate that an image is “free for noncommercial use” from the passage. Unfortunately, that definition is oversimplified, much like that in the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook,'' given that Creative Commons licenses apply to more than images and include more options than “free for noncommercial use.”

Finally, ''Writing Matters'' refers to Creative Commons in the chapter on “Writing for Multiple Media,” as part of a list of information to include on a website:
<blockquote>
'''Copyright or Creative Commons notice.''' All material published on the web is automatically protected by copyright. Remind readers of this fact by including a copyright notice: “Copyright © 2017 Paul Jefferson.” For the copyright date, use the year in which you created or last updated the page. An increasingly popular alternative notice is a Creative Commons License. Browse the Creative Commons website (http://creativecommons.org/) to learn more about this project. (10b, p. 182)
</blockquote>
Note that while copyright is explained, Creative Commons is identified only as an “alternative notice.” For the specific information, students must go elsewhere. Given that students are following these instructions to create their own websites, they will surely need more information before they can determine how to apply a Creative Commons license to their work.

 ''The St. Martin’s Handbook'' seems to agree that students need a thorough understanding of IP concepts, like Creative Commons. In its chapter on “Acknowledging Sources and Avoiding Plagiarism,”  ''St. Martin’s'' asserts:
<blockquote>
As a writer today, you need to understand current definitions of plagiarism, which have changed over time and vary from culture to culture, as well as the concept of intellectual property — those works protected by copyright or by alternatives such as a Creative Commons license — so you can give credit where credit is due. (14, p. 241)
</blockquote>
Unfortunately, neither the ''St. Martin’s Handbook'' nor any of the other handbooks reviewed provides an explanation that explores all aspects of a Creative Commons license in a manner that would provide students a complete understanding of Creative Commons..


=== Attribution and Credits in Static and Dynamic Texts ===
Despite the fact that these ten handbooks consider documentation for images, audio, and video and cover at least some aspects of IP rights, they all fall short in their explanation of how to cite borrowed assets in static and dynamic texts that do not fit the form of word processor-style documents and webpages.

=== Identification of Gaps in Current Resources ===

In some cases, the information is misleading. In its chapter “Compose in Online Genres,” ''The Writer’s Handbook'' includes a section on creating podcasts that implicitly refers to copyright in this step of its step-by-step “process for creating a podcast”:
<blockquote>
'''Know the law'''
If you use music created by someone else, you likely will have to pay for the right to broadcast that music. If someone agrees to be your guest, you have the right to broadcast that person’s voice. (16b, p 154)

</blockquote>
Granted, the passage does allow for other options by stating “you ''likely'' will” (emphasis mine); however, the statement glosses over the possibility that the “music created by someone else” may be in the public domain, copyright-protected but royalty-free, or available for free use under a Creative Commons license. While the admonition to “know the law” is important, failing to consider all the situations the student podcaster may encounter creates a significant gap in the coverage.

Further, the chapter does not include the “know the law” step in the other sections of the chapter. The section on creating web pages states only, “Provide links to sources” (16a, p. 152), with no details on the permissions to consider when incorporating images, audio, or video that the student did not create.

The section on creating videos specifically suggests that the composer may incorporate the work of others in the ''Plan your content'' step: “Will all the video be original? Will you incorporate other video such as YouTube clips? Will you include still images? Maps or graphs? Music? Voiceover?” (16c, p. 155). Despite this specific reference to borrowed assets, the step-by-step process for videos does not mention the significance of knowing the related IP rights and laws nor citing borrowed sources.

There are similar gaps in the series of checklists included in the “Genre Design Gallery” chapter of  ''In Conversation.''

includes a series of checklists that cover creating multimodal essays, multimedia presentations, websites, infographics, and academic essays as well as paraphrasing and summarizing.






Guessing: Little to no support for how to provide attribution for sources used in heavily-multimodal composing. Privileging of linguistic text sources and text-focused systems of attribution.


Frustratingly, their coverage of citing these sources relies on adding research-paper style citations, such as an MLA bibliographic citation for an image, a clunky option for students creating projects that take the form of static images, animations, audio recordings, and videos. These solutions are not an authentic representation of how composers customarily document their sources in these kinds of texts. Imagine, if you will, MLA citations for the songs in the soundtrack of the end of the next blockbuster movie you watch.



== Best Practices ==

=== Identification of Alternative Instructional Resources ===

Pull from [http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/ http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/]

Fair use is a legal concept that describes when it is acceptable to use works protected by copyright. Fair use is determined by four principles, which you can read more about in your textbook:

* '''How will the work be used?''' Is it for commentary, education, research, etc.? Will someone profit financially from it?
* '''What kind of work is it?''' In particular, has it been published?
* '''How much of the work will be used?''' All of it? Most of it? A little of it?
* '''How will the use effect the sales of the original?''' Will people still buy/use the original?

Use the flowchart on [http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2014/07/14/can-i-use-that-picture/ Can I Use that Picture? The Terms, Laws, and Ethics for Using Copyrighted Images], from Curtis Newbold, to decide if you your use of a source is fair use.

Use the [http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/ Fair Use Evaluator], from the American Library Association, for a thorough analysis and to write a justification of your use.

== Ideal Strategies ==

=== Arguments for Handbook Revision ===

==== Documentation and Citation ====

==== Attribution and Credits ====

==== Discussion of How Revision Addresses Gaps ====

== Conclusion ==
The primary domain of these handbooks is the print-ready word-processor document. They sometimes mention student-composed webpages and more rarely discuss student-created projects that result in static images, audio recordings, and video. From this perspective, perhaps the handbook authors and editors do not see it as a practical concern to address issues such as how to add an attribution to a persuasive poster or a documentary video.


=== How More Thorough Coverage Addresses Writers’ Needs ===

=== Call to Advocate for More Friendly and Complete Models and Instruction ===

Time for an open source guide to citations and attribution that takes the education away from the publishers, who are more invested in copyright ownership than in free and open systems of citation.
