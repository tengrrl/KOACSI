== Introduction ==
The first-year writing course is no longer the realm solely of basic word processor documents comprised of nothing more than words on a page. Instead, students compose essays that include static images that contribute to their documents. They create static projects (like the visual argument poster on the left) that combine images and linguistic text to build their message. They may even compose digital projects that include audio recordings and video clips.

The assets that students use in these compositions may be their own work, but that just as frequently include materials created by others. A student’s project may include video footage from a network news story, audio clips from an independent podcast, and photographs posted on Twitter by first-hand observers. As they create these projects, students must consider the ownership and copyright of the assets, which can be covered by a variety of intellectual property rights protections—from copyright to Creative Commons licenses. They may encounter resources that are in the public domain, that are royalty-free, and that are covered by commercial licenses (e.g., assets that you pay to use).

In this article, I survey current first-year writing handbooks for instruction on using copyrighted and Creative Commons-licensed resources in citation and attribution practices. By examining the discussion of documentation practices for static images, audio recordings, and video clips in these handbooks, I provide further insight into the gaps in the discussion of ownership, authorship, and copyright in student handbooks published in the U.S. I conclude by offering suggestions for how to address the oversight in these handbooks so that students more fully understand how intellectual property rights as they cite and credit sources.

== Some Definitions ==
For the purposes of this article, we need some definitions; but yo, bitches, imma wait until i finish the other bits to figure out what those words are that need to be defined.

When works feature a Creative Commons license, the originator of the work has provided specific guidelines on how that work can be used by others, without violation of copyright or other intellectual property rights.
fair use and public domain

Multimodal: Following the New London Group

Texts: All kinds of projects that students compose, from word processor-based documents to video and audio recordings.
Documents: Synonymous with Texts.

== Survey of Current Handbooks ==

For this article, I reviewed ten first-year writing handbooks for the following information:
* details on citation and attribution of images, audio, and video sources
* discussion of the composition of static and dynamic texts that go beyond the word processor-based essays
* coverage of Creative Commons licenses and associated use and attribution practices

The review focused on these handbooks (in alphabetical order by title):

I used [https://www.macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/writerdesigner-secondedition-ball ''Writer/Designer'', 2nd ed.] (2018) by Cheryl E. Ball, Jennifer Sheppard, and Kristin L. Arola as a model of a thorough coverage of Creative Commons and of attribution practices in texts that go beyond the word processor-based essays.

To ensure a thorough search of these handbooks and ''Writer/Designer'', I used digital versions of the handbooks obtained through the [https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/ Vital Source Bookshelf] and the related search tools on the Vital Source website. I also reviewed the sections on research, documentation, and plagiarism in all the handbooks and checked specifically for references to the following terms using the search tools:

* Creative Commons
* copyright
* fair use
* public domain
* visuals
* video
* audio

== Documentation and Citation ==
Most handbooks adopted for first-year writing courses, including the ten reviewed for this article, focus on the customary curricula of essays and reports written in various genres—from description and narrative to persuasion and argument.  Documented research projects comprise a strong portion of these texts, with sections that demonstrate how to evaluate potential sources, integrate found materials into drafts, and cite sources used in these documents.

Each of the ten handbooks include information on how to write in-text citations and bibliographic entries for static images, audio recordings, and video in  MLA, APA, and Chicago style formats. Nine of the ten also cover the CSE style format, with ''A Writer’s Reference'' as the exception. Additionally, each handbook discusses the research process, covering how to gather and evaluate resources, how to use resources in a research project, and how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism. Finally, each includes a deep cache of examples that demonstrate how these steps in the research process work.

Where these ten handbooks differ is in the ways that they address research projects that include static images, animations, audio recordings, and videos. Those that discuss these resources, typically mention the importance of citing these sources properly.

A number of these handbooks xxx copyright, often as part of a discussion of plagiarism.

While they discuss fair use, some gloss over how the concept applies in different situations.

Further, only half of the handbooks mention Creative Commons, and seven of the ten handbooks mention public domain. For both topics however, the handbooks that do mention the concepts typically do not discuss the concepts fully or explain how they relate to copyright. ''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'', for instance, provides only a definition of the term ''public domain'':  “'''public domain'''—phrase used to refer to works that are not granted or are no longer granted exclusive protection by copyright law” (68b, p. 388).



Frustratingly, their coverage of citing these sources relies on adding research-paper style citations, such as an MLA bibliographic citation for an image, a clunky option for students creating projects that take the form of static images, animations, audio recordings, and videos. Beyond clunky, in fact, these solutions are not an authentic representation of how composers customarily document their sources in these kinds of texts. Imagine, if you will, MLA citations for the songs in the soundtrack of the end of the next blockbuster movie you watch.

==== Attribution and Credits ====

Little discussion of attribution and credits in what Writer/Designer refers to as "more overtly multimodal" texts. (p. 8)

=== Identification of Gaps in Current Resources ===

Guessing: Little to no support for how to provide attribution for sources used in heavily-multimodal composing. Privileging of linguistic text sources and text-focused systems of attribution.

== Best Practices ==

=== Identification of Alternative Instructional Resources ===

Pull from [http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/ http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/]

Fair use is a legal concept that describes when it is acceptable to use works protected by copyright. Fair use is determined by four principles, which you can read more about in your textbook:

* '''How will the work be used?''' Is it for commentary, education, research, etc.? Will someone profit financially from it?
* '''What kind of work is it?''' In particular, has it been published?
* '''How much of the work will be used?''' All of it? Most of it? A little of it?
* '''How will the use effect the sales of the original?''' Will people still buy/use the original?

Use the flowchart on [http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2014/07/14/can-i-use-that-picture/ Can I Use that Picture? The Terms, Laws, and Ethics for Using Copyrighted Images], from Curtis Newbold, to decide if you your use of a source is fair use.

Use the [http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/ Fair Use Evaluator], from the American Library Association, for a thorough analysis and to write a justification of your use.

== Ideal Strategies ==

=== Arguments for Handbook Revision ===

==== Documentation and Citation ====

==== Attribution and Credits ====

==== Discussion of How Revision Addresses Gaps ====

== Conclusion ==
The primary domain of these handbooks is the print-ready word-processor document. They sometimes mention student-composed webpages and more rarely discuss student-created projects that result in static images, audio recordings, and video. From this perspective, perhaps the handbook authors and editors do not see it as a practical concern to address issues such as how to add an attribution to a persuasive poster or a documentary video.


=== How More Thorough Coverage Addresses Writers’ Needs ===

=== Call to Advocate for More Friendly and Complete Models and Instruction ===

Time for an open source guide to citations and attribution that takes the education away from the publishers, who are more invested in copyright ownership than in free and open systems of citation.
