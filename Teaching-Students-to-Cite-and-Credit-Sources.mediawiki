== Introduction ==
The first-year writing course no longer focuses solely on basic word processor documents comprised of nothing more than words on a page. Instead, students compose essays that include static images that contribute to their documents. They create static projects (like the visual argument poster on the left) that combine images and linguistic text to build their messages. They may even compose digital projects that include audio recordings and video clips.

The assets that students use in these compositions may be their own work, but they just as frequently include materials created by others. A student’s research project may include video footage from a network news story, audio clips from an independent podcast, and photographs posted on Instagram by first-hand observers. As they create these projects, students must consider the ownership and copyright of the assets, which can be covered by a variety of intellectual property (IP) rights protections—from copyright to Creative Commons licenses. They may encounter resources that are in the public domain, that are royalty-free, and that are covered by commercial licenses (e.g., assets that you pay to use).

In this article, I survey current first-year writing handbooks for instruction on using copyrighted and Creative Commons-licensed resources in citation and attribution practices. By examining the discussion of documentation practices for static images, audio recordings, and video clips in these handbooks, I provide further insight into the gaps in the discussion of ownership, authorship, and copyright in student handbooks published in the U.S. I conclude by offering suggestions for how to address the oversight in these handbooks so that students more fully understand how IP rights as they cite and credit sources.

== Survey of Current Handbooks ==

For this article, I reviewed ten first-year writing handbooks for instruction on documentation of images, audio, and video sources, coverage of IP rights, and attribution and credits in static and dynamic texts that go beyond word processor-based essays. My review focused on these handbooks (in alphabetical order by title):

I used [https://www.macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/writerdesigner-secondedition-ball ''Writer/Designer'', 2nd ed.] (2018) by Cheryl E. Ball, Jennifer Sheppard, and Kristin L. Arola as a model of a thorough coverage of Creative Commons and of attribution practices in texts that go beyond the word processor-based essays.

To ensure a thorough search of these handbooks and ''Writer/Designer'', I used digital versions of the handbooks obtained through the [https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/ Vital Source Bookshelf] and the related search tools on the Vital Source website. I also reviewed the sections on research, documentation, and plagiarism in all the handbooks and used the site’s full-text search tools to check specifically for references to Creative Commons, copyright, fair use, and  public domain.
=== Documentation of Images, Audio, and Video Sources ===
Most handbooks adopted for first-year writing courses, including the ten reviewed for this article, focus on the customary curricula of essays and reports written in various genres—from description and narrative to persuasion and argument.  Documented research projects comprise a strong portion of these texts, with sections that demonstrate how to evaluate potential sources, integrate found materials into drafts, and cite sources used in these documents.

Each of the ten handbooks include information on how to write in-text citations and bibliographic entries for static images, audio recordings, and video in  MLA, APA, and Chicago style formats. Nine of the ten also cover the CSE style format, with ''A Writer’s Reference'' as the exception. Additionally, each handbook discusses the research process, covering how to gather and evaluate resources, how to use resources in a research project, and how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism. Finally, each includes a deep cache of examples that demonstrate how these steps in the research process work.

Where these ten handbooks differ is in the ways that they address research projects that include (rather than simply refer to, quote, paraphrase, or summarize) static images, audio recordings, and videos. Those that discuss these resources, emphasize the importance of citing the sources properly. ''Keys for Writers'' explains, “As a general rule, whichever style of documentation you use, you need to identify and label a visual source, such as a figure or a table, where you include it in your paper. Be sure to give credit to the original source of the image” (7e, p. 162).

In its discussion of website projects, the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' states, “Always cite material that you do not generate yourself,” and outlines these specific suggestions: “If your Web text will be public, request permission for use of material not in the public domain unless the site says permission is not needed. Check for a credit in the source, and if the contact information of the creator is not apparent, e-mail the sponsor of the site and ask for it”  (14c-2, p. 251).

''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' also addresses visual sources that are included in word processor-style documents, explaining “When using an image from another source, be sure to cite it correctly. If the image will appear on a public Web site, ask the copyright holder for permission.” (17b-3, p. 298).

There are exceptions to the coverage of documentation of images, audio, and video sources however. ''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'', for example, outlines the following “Information That Requires Documentation,” focusing primarily on “words”:
<blockquote>
* '''Words taken directly from a source.''' If you quote a source, enclose the quotation in quotation marks and include an in-text citation.
* '''Specific ideas, findings, conclusions, and arguments taken from a source, even if you put them in your own words.''' If you put someone else’s ideas in your own words, you are paraphrasing his or her information. If the passage from the source is long and you shorten it and put it in your own words, you are summarizing his or her ideas. In both cases, an in-text citation is needed.
* '''Statistics, figures, and the results of a study.''' Unless you have conducted your own study and created your own set of statistics, you have probably used a source to get this data. Cite the source of the data. (emphasis original, 68b, p. 386)
</blockquote>
Following the advice from this list, a student may surmise that no documentation is needed for borrowed photographs, drawings, video clips, and other resources that go beyond words on a printable page.

=== Coverage of IP Rights ===
In their discussion of the research and composing processes, these handbooks refer to IP rights as part of their explanation of why documentation is necessary. In particular, the textbooks focus on the ownership of resources that students may incorporate in their projects, addressing how to find sources they can use and how to determine when permission is required to use those sources.

In this context, students need details on how copyright and Creative Commons licenses work, what it means for an asset to be in the public domain, and how fair use governs the permission required to use a source. All ten handbooks mention copyright and cover some aspects of IP rights, but only ''Keys for Writers'', ''The Little, Brown Handbook'', and ''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' mention all four IP concepts (copyright, Creative Commons, fair use, and public domain).   Eight of the handbooks include the term fair use, and seven mention public domain. Only half of the handbooks refer to Creative Commons.

The table below shows which of the IP concepts are covered in the ten handbooks. A “Yes” in the table indicates that the topic is mentioned in the handbook.

''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' has the most extensive discussion of IP rights of the ten handbooks. The terms are explained in the section on plagiarism:
<blockquote>
Related to plagiarism are the concepts of copyright and intellectual property. '''Copyright''' is the legal right to control the reproduction of an original work—a piece of writing, a musical composition, a play, a movie, a computer program, a photograph, a work of art. A copyrighted work is the '''intellectual property''' of the copyright holder, whether that entity is a publisher, a record company, an entertainment conglomerate, or the individual creator of the work. (emphasis original, 20a, p. 321)
</blockquote>
Following this overview, ''McGraw-Hill'' explains copyright, fair use, and intellectual property in more detail (20a1–3, pp. 321–327) and includes a highlight box with links to additional information for “Learning More about Plagiarism, Copyright and Fair Use, and Intellectual Property” (p. 325).

''McGraw-Hill'' also addresses the use of copyrighted images, audio, and video, outlining the four questions that are used to determine fair use:
<blockquote>
* '''What is the purpose of the use?''' Educational, nonprofit, and personal uses are more likely to be considered fair than commercial use.
* '''What is the nature of the work being used?''' In most cases, imaginative and unpublished materials can be used only if you have the permission of the copyright holder.
* '''What effect would this use have on the market for the original?''' The use of a work is usually considered unfair if it would hurt sales of the original.
* '''How much of the copyrighted work is being used?''' The use of a small portion of a text is more likely to be considered fair than copying a whole work. (20c, p. 325, 327)
</blockquote>
While the text does not identify these questions as related specifically to fair use, the section’s focus “Use copyrighted materials fairly” clearly alludes to the concept.

==== Limitations in Handbook References to IP Concepts ====
By comparison to the full details in the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook,'' some of the handbooks include only superficial references to the IP concepts. ''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'', for instance, provides only a definition of the term ''public domain'':  “'''public domain'''—phrase used to refer to works that are not granted or are no longer granted exclusive protection by copyright law” (68b, p. 388). The text includes no further discussion of the term and no examples, leaving students to suss out how the idea of public domain relates to their work.

''The Writer’s Handbook'' includes only a cursory reference to the concept of fair use: “́The ''Chicago Manual'' also gives advice on copyright law, such as how a work is granted copyright, what may constitute copyright violation, and what is fair use” (25a, p. 319). To learn about fair use, the student using the ''Writer’s Handbook'' must presumably search out a copy of the ''Chicago Manual.''

In some cases, the information is incomplete or misleading. In its chapter “Compose in Online Genres,” ''The Writer’s Handbook'' includes a section on creating podcasts that alludes to copyright, but oversimplifies the range of permissions possible:
<blockquote>
'''Know the law:'''
If you use music created by someone else, you likely will have to pay for the right to broadcast that music. If someone agrees to be your guest, you have the right to broadcast that person’s voice. (16b, p 154)

</blockquote>
Granted, the passage does allow for other options by stating “you ''likely'' will” (emphasis mine); however, the statement glosses over the possibility that the “music created by someone else” may be in the public domain, copyright-protected but royalty-free, or available for free use under a Creative Commons license. It doesn’t even indicate what law it is the student needs to know. While the admonition to “know the law” is important, failing to consider all the situations the student podcaster may encounter creates a significant gap in the coverage.

Further, the chapter does not include the “know the law” step in the other sections of the chapter. The section on creating web pages states only, “Provide links to sources” (16a, p. 152), with no details on the permissions to consider when incorporating images, audio, or video that the student did not create. Linking to a source is obviously not the same as documenting it and does not in any way correlate with permission for using that source.

''The Writer’s Handbook’s''  section on creating videos specifically suggests that the composer may incorporate the work of others in the ''Plan your content'' step: “Will all the video be original? Will you incorporate other video such as YouTube clips? Will you include still images? Maps or graphs? Music? Voiceover?” (16c, p. 155). Despite this specific reference to borrowed assets, the step-by-step process for creating videos does not mention the significance of knowing the related IP rights and laws nor citing the borrowed sources.

This final example from the ''St. Martin’s Handbook'' jumps from copyright to open source to personal privacy:
<blockquote>
'''14f Considering your intellectual property'''<br />

Although you may not have thought too much about it, all of your work in college — including all the research and writing you do, online and off — represents a growing bank of intellectual property. In fact, such original work is automatically copyrighted, even if it lacks the © symbol. But remember that the open source movement is gaining momentum and that sharing your ideas and writing freely with others is a way to perpetuate them and to gain an audience for your views.<br />

For work that you want to protect, here are some tips for making sure that others respect your intellectual property just as you respect theirs:<br />
* Realize that your text and email messages, blog posts and comments, and posts to social networking sites and discussion groups are essentially public. If you don’t want your thoughts and ideas repeated or forwarded, keep them offline. Let recipients know specifically when you do not want your email messages passed on to any third parties. In turn, remember that you should not use material from email, discussion groups, or other online forums without first asking for permission.
* Be careful with your passwords, and use a secure storage method so that only you can give someone access to your work.
* Save all your drafts and notes so that you can show where your work has come from should anyone ask you. (14f, p. 247)
</blockquote>
This passage begins with a brief explanation of students’ own copyright of the works they create. Confusingly, it moves next to the “open source movement,” a term used to describe software licenses. While open source is clearly related to copyright, it is not the best concept to use in this context.  A discussion of Creative Commons licensing would have been more appropriate, since it is the system used to allow less restrictive sharing and collaboration of the kind of projects students create in first-year composition.

Next the passage addresses actions that students can take to protect their intellectual property. Rather than connecting these actions to copyright however, the text seems to blame the victim with warnings to be careful of digital security issues. In short, the section brings up complicated issues of the ownership of publicly posted material without exploring the underlying IP rights or discussing how students can enforce their rights. While there are places at the ''St. Martin’s Handbook'' shines, like its discussion of fair use in relation to images (13e, p.237), this section on “Considering your intellectual property” could be improved.

==== Coverage of Creative Commons ====
To demonstrate the gaps in coverage of IP concepts more fully, I will examine the specific discussion of Creative Commons licenses in these texts. Five of the handbooks—''The McGraw-Hill Handbook,'' the ''St. Martin’s Handbook,'' the ''Little, Brown Handbook,'' ''Keys for Writers,'' and ''Writing Matters''—mention the Creative Commons specifically, though with differing levels of detail.

Of the ten handbooks, the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' provides the most details of the five, explaining  Creative Commons in reference to finding images to use in projects:
<blockquote>
The ''Creative Commons'' site (&lt;www.creativecommons.org&gt;) lets you search for material with a Creative Commons license. Such a license specifies the permitted uses of the content. The material shown can be reproduced or altered for noncommercial purposes, as long as it is cited. All the images accompanying ''Wikipedia'' are licensed through ''Creative Commons,'' so that is another source. (17b-2, p. 300)
</blockquote>
An ideal description of Creative Commons would include [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ all the possible licenses] and explain their requirements in more specific detail . For instance, in addition to its noncommercial license, an image may be under an attribution license, which requires identification of the resource’s owner. Perhaps ''McGraw-Hill'' omits these particular details since students must cite all their sources anyway; however, this fact does not account for the failure to explain Creative Commons’ nonderivative and share-alike licensing.

''Keys for Writers'' simply mentions Creative Commons in a passage on evaluating whether an image can be used in a student project:
<blockquote>
Keep in mind, however, that unless the creator of the image has explicitly stated that it is free for noncommercial use (either by a statement on the Web site or by using a Creative Commons license), you should assume that the image is copyrighted and not free for the taking.
</blockquote>
Presumably readers of ''Keys for Writers'' will deduce the definition of Creative Commons as a way to indicate that an image is “free for noncommercial use” from the passage. Unfortunately, that definition is oversimplified, much like that in ''McGraw-Hill,'' given that Creative Commons licenses apply to more than images and include more options than “free for noncommercial use.”

''The St. Martin’s Handbook'' moves beyond images to include sound in its explanation of Creative Commons. The handbook gives readers a short definition in its section on “Creating audio and video projects,” relying on an implicit comparison to licensing options that require permission for use:
<blockquote>
Will you need sound or images from other sources? If so, where can you acquire what you need? If you use the work of others in a project that will be posted for the public, you may need to seek permission from the rightsholders (see Chapter 14). However, critiquing or analyzing someone else’s work in your own project is often considered a “fair use” that does not require permission. You may also want to look for images and sounds distributed under a Creative Commons license, which allows others to use them freely. (18c, p. 290)
</blockquote>
This passage does not fully explain Creative Commons licenses, but it does suggest that the license is a useful option for projects that move beyond word processor-style essays. ''The Little, Brown Handbook'' follows a similar strategy, providing few details and sending students to a librarian for more information:
<blockquote>
To avoid having to seek permission [for  visual, audio, and video sources], you can search Web sites such as Google, Flickr Creative Commons, and Wikimedia Commons for media that are not protected by copyright. On Google, for instance, go to “Search tools” and select “Labeled for reuse.” Consult a librarian at your school if you have questions. (42i, p. 575)
</blockquote>
''Little, Brown'' improves on the ''St. Martin’s Handbook''  by indicating places where students can find Creative Commons resources, but it does not explain the related licenses at all. Further, ''Little, Brown'' includes the incorrect assertion that these “media that are not protected by copyright.” As [https://creativecommons.org/faq/#is-creative-commons-against-copyright the Creative Commons FAQ] explains, “CC licenses are copyright licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators and other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights.”  Taken literally, students can certainly search out “media that are not protected by copyright” ; however, the passage suggests a Creative Commons searches will provide those media, which is at best misleading.

While the other four handbooks discuss Creative Commons in the context of using assets created by others, ''Writing Matters'' refers to Creative Commons in its checklist of information writers should include when creating a website. In the chapter on “Writing for Multiple Media,” ''Writing Matters'' tells readers to indicate their preferred IP licensing on the websites they compose:
<blockquote>
'''Copyright or Creative Commons notice.''' All material published on the web is automatically protected by copyright. Remind readers of this fact by including a copyright notice: “Copyright © 2017 Paul Jefferson.” For the copyright date, use the year in which you created or last updated the page. An increasingly popular alternative notice is a Creative Commons License. Browse the Creative Commons website (http://creativecommons.org/) to learn more about this project. (10b, p. 182)
</blockquote>
Note that although copyright is explained, Creative Commons is identified only as an “alternative notice.” For the specific information, students must go elsewhere.

Given that students are following these instructions to create their own websites, they will surely need more information before they can determine how to apply a Creative Commons license to their work. Unfortunately, none of the handbooks reviewed provides an explanation that explores all aspects of a Creative Commons license in a manner that would provide students the information they need to choose a license for their own work or to interpret the licenses that apply to assets they want incorporate in their projects.
=== Attribution and Credits in Static and Dynamic Texts ===
For students writing word processor-based academic essays, any of the ten handbooks will provide them all the details they need on how to document images, audio, and video that they describe or quote in their projects.

Naturally, all of the handbooks instruct readers to cite the sources that they incorporate in their projects, as these examples demonstrate:
*''Writing Matters'' explains, “Whenever you borrow images from an outside source, be sure to identify your source, either in the figure caption (for most illustrations) or in a source note (for tables)” (5c, p. 84).
*''A Writer’s Reference'' reminds students, “Keep in mind that if you download a visual or use published information to create your own visual, you must credit your source” (C2b, p. 17).
*''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'' states, “'''Give credit to your sources:''' Use the citation style requested by your instructor. In many programs, you can also insert links to the sources you refer to in your writing” (4c, p. 46).
*''The DK Handbook'' indicates that “If in your composition you use a photograph, painting, drawing, chart, diagram, graph, or table made by someone else, you need to cite the source” (p. 261).
*''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' (as noted above) instructs, “When using an image from another source, be sure to cite it correctly” (17b-3, p. 298).

With these clear directives to “cite your sources,” the handbooks all emphasize the value of documentation for work that is not students’ own creation. This process is relatively simple for students composing the customary academic essay. Students who are ''not'' creating word processor-based projects, however, face challenges as they go about this process of citing their sources.

In its section on “How to cite visuals,” ''Keys for Writers'' assumes students using visuals are writing customary “papers” and will follow the related documentation styles:
<blockquote>
Provide a number and a source note for all tables and figures you include in your paper. In MLA style, place the visual close to the text it illustrates, with a credit line immediately beneath it. For APA papers, consult with your instructor. Some recommend including visuals within the text of a college paper; others adhere to strict APA style, with tables and figures placed at the end of the paper. (9c, p. 182)
</blockquote>

In its section “Use Visuals Effectively,” the  ''Writer’s Handbook'' likewise proceeds as though that students are composing traditional academic essays:
<blockquote>
Like quotations, visuals should not be dropped in without introductions.
* Place all visuals as close as possible to the related text.
* Introduce each visual in your text. In MLA style give each visual a figure number (abbreviated Fig.) and a caption.
* Give complete information about the source in the caption.
* If the source is not mentioned in the text, you do not need to include it in the list of works cited. (21g, p. 217)
</blockquote>
Note that visuals are given figure numbers and captions, and possibly listed on the works cited page. None of these strategies for integrating and documenting visuals would make sense in an audio or video project.

''In Conversation'' gives broader attention to “nontextual sources” in this “Writer to Writer” highlight box that addresses projects beyond word processor-based documents:

[http://github.com/tengrrl/KOACSI/Writer2Writer-usingimages.png “Writer to Writer” Screenshot from ''In Conversation'']

<img src=https://github.com/tengrrl/KOACSI/raw/master/images/Writer2Writer-usingimages.png />

[# Transcript for “Writer to Writer” image]
----
How should I integrate nontextual sources in a digital document? In a web page or a multimedia presentation, use the following approach for integrating digital illustrations.

* Make a link between your document and a document that contains an image, sound clip, or video clip — rather than simply copying the image and placing it in your document.
* If it isn’t possible or appropriate to create a link to another document, you should contact the owner of the image, sound clip, or video clip for permission to use it.
* If you cannot contact the owner, review the discussion of fair use on page 152 for guidance about using the material.

As you’ve done for the other sources you cite in your document, make sure you present images, audio, or video fairly and identify their authors or creators.
----
The advice here is for students to link to images, audio, and video rather than include them in their projects. Following this suggestion does circumvent any permissions issues related to using the assets, but it ultimately limits the project.  For example, a student who chooses an audio recording as background music for a project would fundamentally change the project by asking readers to click a link rather than automatically playing background music.


==== Hereforth it falls apart ====
The textbook does advise
“ it isn’t possible or appropriate to create a link to another document”
no discussion of fair use or Creative Commons alternatives, either of which could eliminate the complication of contacting the asset owner.




Frustratingly, their coverage of citing these sources relies on adding research-paper style citations, such as an MLA bibliographic citation for an image, a clunky option for students creating projects that take the form of static images, animations, audio recordings, and videos. These solutions are not an authentic representation of how composers customarily document their sources in these kinds of texts. Imagine, if you will, MLA citations for the songs in the soundtrack of the end of the next blockbuster movie you watch.




=== Identification of Gaps in Current Resources ===

Next???

Guessing: Little to no support for how to provide attribution for sources used in heavily-multimodal composing. Privileging of linguistic text sources and text-focused systems of attribution.






== Best Practices ==

=== Identification of Alternative Instructional Resources ===

Pull from [http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/ http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/]

Fair use is a legal concept that describes when it is acceptable to use works protected by copyright. Fair use is determined by four principles, which you can read more about in your textbook:

* '''How will the work be used?''' Is it for commentary, education, research, etc.? Will someone profit financially from it?
* '''What kind of work is it?''' In particular, has it been published?
* '''How much of the work will be used?''' All of it? Most of it? A little of it?
* '''How will the use effect the sales of the original?''' Will people still buy/use the original?

Use the flowchart on [http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2014/07/14/can-i-use-that-picture/ Can I Use that Picture? The Terms, Laws, and Ethics for Using Copyrighted Images], from Curtis Newbold, to decide if you your use of a source is fair use.

Use the [http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/ Fair Use Evaluator], from the American Library Association, for a thorough analysis and to write a justification of your use.

== Ideal Strategies ==

=== Arguments for Handbook Revision ===

* Full explanation of Creative Commons, with examples and potential sources
* Full explanation of Public Domain, with examples and potential sources
* Full explanation of Fair Use, again, with examples
* New guidelines for attribution and credit of iimages, audio, and video in digital projects
* Extensive examples of attribution system in authentic projects

== Conclusion ==
The primary domain of these handbooks is the print-ready word-processor document. They sometimes mention student-composed webpages and more rarely discuss student-created projects that result in static images, audio recordings, and video. From this perspective, perhaps the handbook authors and editors do not see it as a practical concern to address issues such as how to add an attribution to a persuasive poster or a documentary video.


=== How More Thorough Coverage Addresses Writers’ Needs ===

=== Call to Advocate for More Friendly and Complete Models and Instruction ===

Time for an open source guide to citations and attribution that takes the education away from the publishers, who are more invested in copyright ownership than in free and open systems of citation.

== Some Definitions ==
For the purposes of this article, we need some definitions; but yo, bitches, imma wait until i finish the other bits to figure out what those words are that need to be defined.

When works feature a Creative Commons license, the originator of the work has provided specific guidelines on how that work can be used by others, without violation of copyright or other intellectual property rights.
fair use and public domain

Multimodal: Following the New London Group

Texts: All kinds of projects that students compose, from word processor-based documents to video and audio recordings.
Documents: Synonymous with Texts.

Word Processor-Based Documents (but what about wiki, webpages, blogs, etc?????)
Slideshows
Videos
Audio Recordings
Images

Performance-based Projects
Analog projects
Digital Projects

Static Texts
Dynamic Texts

Complete coverage of all four IP concepts is also included in the ''Little, Brown Handbook'' section on “Obtaining Permission When Publishing Your Work.” The section provides a general explanation of fair use: “The legal convention of fair use allows an author to use a small portion of copyrighted material without obtaining the copyright holder's permission, as long as the author acknowledges the source” (44d, p. 622). Specific guidelines follow for using text borrowed from print or online sources, using borrowed images, audio, and video, and using borrowed assets that are not copyrighted and for which copyright is not claimed.


Keys, 9a, p. 180

LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
Ownership Rights across Cultures
American academic culture takes seriously the ownership of words and text. It respects both the individual as author (and authority) and the originality of the individual’s ideas. In some cultures, mem- orization and the use of classic texts are common in all walks of life. And worldwide, the ownership of language, texts, music, and videos is being called into question by the democratic, interactive nature of the Internet. In short, therefore, plagiarism is not something univer- sal and easy to define. In American academic culture, basic ground rules exist for the “fair use” of another writer’s work without pay- ment, but easy access to music and media sources poses interesting questions about intellectual property and the opportunities to create and remix culture.

Keys 22e, p. 406

Sophisticated and original graphics are usually copyrighted, so if you intend to use an image in a document that you post on the Web or make widely available in print, you must do more than download the image and cite the source. The “fair use” principle of copyright law allows use of a small portion of a source in a noncommercial work, but you may need to write to the originator for permission to use an image or text.
For a college paper intended for your classmates and instructor alone and not posted publicly on the Web, you may want to include an illustration you find on the Web, such as a graph, a map, a photograph of an author or artist, a work of art, or an illustration from an online ency- clopedia. You can do so without getting permission, but you must cite the source in your paper.

IC 10.3, p. 153
The concept of fair use deals with how much of a source you can borrow or quote. According to Section 107 of the Copyright Act of 1976 — the fair use provision, available at copyright.gov/title17/ — writers can use copyrighted materials for purposes of “criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research.” In other words, writers generally don’t need to seek permission to use brief quotations from a source or to summarize or paraphrase a source.

DK, Part 4, p. 117
Fair Use
Fair use, a doctrine in copyright law, allows certain uses of others’ copyrighted material without permission. Fair use does not specify how much of another’s work one may use; instead, four factors are considered, in legal cases, to determine if a use is fair:
1	The purpose and character of the use. Is the use commercial or is it for nonprofit and educational purposes (such as criticism, parody, or art)? Fair use is meant to support public, not personal, enrichment. If the use transforms the copied work, making something new of it, that is also more likely to be considered fair use.
2	The nature of the copyrighted work. Generally, uses of published nonfiction works are considered to benefit the public—and not harm the rights of a copyright holder—more so than uses of unpublished or fictional works.
3	The amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole. The less one copies, the more likely the copying is to be considered fair use.
4	The effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work. If the use will not cause the copyright holder to lose income, it is more likely to be considered fair use.
The doctrine of fair use underpins academic uses of the words of others—as in research writing—which is what we discuss in this part of this book. Fair use protects most academic uses of intellectual property—but as soon as you use that property for personal gain or commercial ends, the use is no longer protected.
WM, 1b-3, pp.9
Obtain copyright clearance While plagiarism is concerned with acknowledging sources of ideas or language, copyright focuses on the right to compensation for the use of writers’ words and ideas in a public context. When writers use a substantial portion of another writer’s text, they must not only acknowledge the source but may also need to obtain the original author’s permission, often in exchange for a fee.

As a student, your use of sources is covered under the fair use provision of US copyright law, which allows you to include copyrighted material without permission when you are doing your college assignments. What counts as fair use cannot be expressed in percentages or checklists. The Center for Social Media at American University offers a “Code of Best Practices in Fair Use for Media Literacy Education” that you can find online. It explains that if you copy someone else’s text or music files and avoid paying for it, you are violating copyright. But if you are using parts of a text or a song for educational purposes, and if you are not interfering with the copyright owner’s ability to profit from the material, you are making fair use of it and do not need the copyright owner’s permission. Because plagiarism and copyright are separate issues, though, you must always acknowledge your source, even when no permission is needed.




Note all talk only about “media” resources, not text; and there are limitations even there.

Mcgh and keys refer to images
sm to sound and images
lb to visual, audio, and video sources
wm to a website (in its entirety, rather than specific assets)

Students composing static or dynamic texts that take the form of images, audio, and video, however, are not as likely to find the information they need.
