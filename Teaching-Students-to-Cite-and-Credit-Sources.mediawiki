= Introduction =

The first-year writing course no longer focuses solely on basic word processor documents comprised of nothing more than words on a page. Instead, students compose essays that include static images that contribute to their documents. They create static projects that combine images and linguistic text to build their messages. They may even compose digital projects that include audio recordings and video clips.

The assets students use in these compositions may be their own work, but they just as frequently include materials created by others. A student’s research project may include video footage from a network news story, audio clips from an independent podcast, and photographs posted on Instagram by first-hand observers. As they create these projects, students must consider the ownership and copyright of the assets, which can be covered by a variety of intellectual property (IP) rights protections—from copyright to Creative Commons licenses. Students may encounter resources that are in the public domain, that are royalty-free, and that are covered by commercial licenses (e.g., assets that you pay to use).

In this article, I survey first-year writing handbooks for instruction on using copyrighted and Creative Commons-licensed resources in citation and attribution practices. By examining the discussion of documentation practices for static images, audio recordings, and video clips in these handbooks, I provide further insight into the gaps in the discussion of ownership, authorship, and copyright in student handbooks published in the U.S. I conclude by offering suggestions for how to address the oversight in these handbooks so students more fully understand how IP rights as they cite and credit sources.

= Survey of Current Handbooks =

For this article, I reviewed ten first-year writing handbooks for instruction on documentation of images, audio, and video sources, coverage of IP rights, and attribution and credits in static and dynamic texts that go beyond word processor-based essays. My review focused on these handbooks (in alphabetical order by title):

I used [https://www.macmillanlearning.com/Catalog/product/writerdesigner-secondedition-ball ''Writer/Designer'', 2nd ed.] (2018) by Cheryl E. Ball, Jennifer Sheppard, and Kristin L. Arola as a model of a complete coverage of Creative Commons and of attribution practices in texts that go beyond the word processor-based essays.

To ensure a thorough search of these handbooks and ''Writer/Designer'', I used digital versions of the handbooks obtained through the [https://bookshelf.vitalsource.com/#/ Vital Source Bookshelf] and the related search tools on the Vital Source website. I also reviewed the sections on research, documentation, and plagiarism in all the handbooks and used the Vital Source’s full-text search tools to check specifically for references to Creative Commons, copyright, fair use, and  public domain.

== Documentation of Images, Audio, and Video Sources ==

Most handbooks adopted for first-year writing courses, including the ten reviewed for this article, focus on the customary curricula of essays and reports written in various genres—from description and narrative to persuasion and argument.  Documented research projects comprise a strong portion of these texts, with sections that demonstrate how to evaluate potential sources, integrate found materials into drafts, and cite sources used in these documents.

Each of the ten handbooks includes information on how to write in-text citations and bibliographic entries for static images, audio recordings, and videos in  MLA, APA, and Chicago style formats. Nine of the ten also cover the CSE style format, with ''A Writer’s Reference'' as the exception. Additionally, each handbook discusses the research process, covering how to gather and evaluate resources, how to use resources in a research project, and how to cite sources and avoid plagiarism. Finally, each includes examples that demonstrate how these steps in the research process work.

Where these ten handbooks differ is in the ways that they address research projects that include (rather than simply refer to, quote, paraphrase, or summarize) static images, audio recordings, and videos. Those that discuss these resources, emphasize the importance of citing the sources properly. ''Keys for Writers'' explains, “As a general rule, whichever style of documentation you use, you need to identify and label a visual source, such as a figure or a table, where you include it in your paper. Be sure to give credit to the original source of the image” (7e, p. 162).

In its discussion of website projects, the ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' states, “Always cite material that you do not generate yourself,” and outlines these specific suggestions: “If your Web text will be public, request permission for use of material not in the public domain unless the site says permission is not needed. Check for a credit in the source, and if the contact information of the creator is not apparent, e-mail the sponsor of the site and ask for it”  (14c-2, p. 251).

''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' also addresses visual sources that are included in word processor-style documents, explaining “When using an image from another source, be sure to cite it correctly. If the image will appear on a public Web site, ask the copyright holder for permission.” (17b-3, p. 298).

There are exceptions to the coverage of documentation of images, audio, and video sources however. ''The Prentice Hall Reference Guide'', for example, outlines the following “Information That Requires Documentation,” focusing primarily on “words”:
<blockquote>
* '''Words taken directly from a source.''' If you quote a source, enclose the quotation in quotation marks and include an in-text citation.
* '''Specific ideas, findings, conclusions, and arguments taken from a source, even if you put them in your own words.''' If you put someone else’s ideas in your own words, you are paraphrasing his or her information. If the passage from the source is long and you shorten it and put it in your own words, you are summarizing his or her ideas. In both cases, an in-text citation is needed.
* '''Statistics, figures, and the results of a study.''' Unless you have conducted your own study and created your own set of statistics, you have probably used a source to get this data. Cite the source of the data. (emphasis original, 68b, p. 386)
</blockquote>
Following the advice from this list, a student may surmise that no documentation is needed for borrowed photographs, drawings, video clips, and other resources that go beyond words on a printable page.

Similarly, in its section on “How to cite visuals,” ''Keys for Writers'' assumes students using visuals are writing customary “papers” and will follow the related documentation styles:

<blockquote>
Provide a number and a source note for all tables and figures you include in your paper. In MLA style, place the visual close to the text it illustrates, with a credit line immediately beneath it. For APA papers, consult with your instructor. Some recommend including visuals within the text of a college paper; others adhere to strict APA style, with tables and figures placed at the end of the paper. (9c, p. 182)
</blockquote>

In its section “Use Visuals Effectively,” the  ''Writer’s Handbook'' likewise proceeds as though students are composing traditional academic essays:
<blockquote>
Like quotations, visuals should not be dropped in without introductions.
* Place all visuals as close as possible to the related text.
* Introduce each visual in your text. In MLA style give each visual a figure number (abbreviated Fig.) and a caption.
* Give complete information about the source in the caption.
* If the source is not mentioned in the text, you do not need to include it in the list of works cited. (21g, p. 217)
</blockquote>
Note that visuals are given figure numbers and captions, and possibly listed on the works cited page. None of these strategies for integrating and documenting visuals would make sense in an audio or video research project.

''In Conversation'' gives broader attention to “nontextual sources” in this “Writer to Writer” highlight box that addresses projects beyond word processor-based documents:

[# Transcript for “Writer to Writer” image]
----
How should I integrate nontextual sources in a digital document? In a web page or a multimedia presentation, use the following approach for integrating digital illustrations.

* Make a link between your document and a document that contains an image, sound clip, or video clip—rather than simply copying the image and placing it in your document.
* If it isn’t possible or appropriate to create a link to another document, you should contact the owner of the image, sound clip, or video clip for permission to use it.
* If you cannot contact the owner, review the discussion of fair use on page 152 for guidance about using the material.

As you’ve done for the other sources you cite in your document, make sure you present images, audio, or video fairly and identify their authors or creators.
----
The advice here is for students to link to images, audio, and video rather than include them in their projects. Following this suggestion does circumvent any permissions issues related to using the assets, but it ultimately limits the project.  For example, a student who chooses an audio recording as background music for a project would fundamentally change the project by asking readers to click a link rather than automatically playing background music. Further, best digital authoring practices avoid hot linking, the process of linking to or embedding an image rather than using a local copy, to ensure the sustainability of the project.

Frustratingly, these handbooks rely primarily on adding research-paper style citations, such as an MLA bibliographic citation for an image, as the method for all sources—a clunky option for students creating projects that take the form of static images, animations, audio recordings, and videos. Imagine, if you will, MLA citations for the songs in the soundtrack of the end of the next documentary movie you watch. The coverage in these handbooks is simply not an authentic representation of how digitally-savvy composers customarily document their sources in texts other than word processor documents and essays.

== Coverage of IP Rights ==

In their discussion of the research and composing processes, these handbooks refer to IP rights as part of their explanation of why documentation is necessary. In particular, the textbooks focus on the ownership of resources that students may incorporate in their projects, addressing how to find sources they can use and how to determine when permission is required to use those sources.

In this context, students need to know how copyright and Creative Commons licenses work, what it means for an asset to be in the public domain, and how fair use governs the permission required to use a source. All ten handbooks mention copyright and cover some aspects of IP rights, but only ''Keys for Writers'', ''The Little, Brown Handbook'', and ''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' mention all four IP concepts (copyright, Creative Commons, fair use, and public domain).   Eight of the handbooks include the term fair use, and seven mention public domain. Only half of the handbooks refer to Creative Commons.

The table below shows which of the IP concepts are covered in the ten handbooks. A “Yes” in the table indicates that the topic is mentioned in the handbook.

=== Copyright, Fair Use, and Public Domain ===

''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' has the most extensive discussion of IP rights of the ten handbooks. The concepts of copyright and intellectual property are introduced in the chapter on “Plagiarism, Copyright, and Intellectual Property”:
<blockquote>
Related to plagiarism are the concepts of copyright and intellectual property. '''Copyright''' is the legal right to control the reproduction of an original work—a piece of writing, a musical composition, a play, a movie, a computer program, a photograph, a work of art. A copyrighted work is the '''intellectual property''' of the copyright holder, whether that entity is a publisher, a record company, an entertainment conglomerate, or the individual creator of the work. (emphasis original, 20a, p. 321)
</blockquote>
Following this overview, ''McGraw-Hill'' explains copyright, fair use, and intellectual property in more detail (20a1–3, pp. 321–327) and includes a highlight box with links to additional information for “Learning More about Plagiarism, Copyright and Fair Use, and Intellectual Property” (p. 325).

As part of the explanation, ''McGraw-Hill'' walks students through a decision-making process by outlining the four questions used to determine fair use:
<blockquote>
Before you publish your work on the Web or produce a multimedia presentation that includes audio, video, and graphic elements copied from a Web site, make sure that you have used copyrighted material fairly by considering these four questions:

* '''What is the purpose of the use?''' Educational, nonprofit, and personal uses are more likely to be considered fair than commercial use.
* '''What is the nature of the work being used?''' In most cases, imaginative and unpublished materials can be used only if you have the permission of the copyright holder.
* '''What effect would this use have on the market for the original?''' The use of a work is usually considered unfair if it would hurt sales of the original.
* '''How much of the copyrighted work is being used?''' The use of a small portion of a text is more likely to be considered fair than copying a whole work. (20c, p. 325, 327)
</blockquote>

While this chapter of ''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' covers the concepts of copyright and fair use thoroughly, the section is missing details on how resources in the public domain relate to intellectual property use. Public domain is mentioned in the chapter on “Multimedia Writing” (Chapter 14), specifically as it pertains to the use of images and videos for web sites:

<blockquote>
Always cite material that you do not generate yourself. If your Web text will be public, request permission for use of material not in the public domain unless the site says permission is not needed. (14c-2, p. 251)
</blockquote>
The other references to public domain appear in Chapter 17, “Finding and Creating Effective Visuals, Audio Clips, and Videos.” The passages, like the one below, suggest where to find resources that can be used in multimedia projects:

<blockquote>
Several libraries and other archival institutions maintain collections of images online. The Library of Congress, for example, is a rich source of images (most in the public domain) relating to American history. Follow the guidelines for usage posted on these sites. (17b-1, p. 299)
</blockquote>
The difficulty of this approach lies in the failure to explain what the term ''public domain'' means. The handbook clearly indicates that the public domain resources are useful, but it does not indicate how or why.

While seven of the handbooks mention public domain, most cover the topic much as ''The McGraw-Hill Handbook'' does—providing little detail or explanation. ''The Prentice-Hall Handbook'' provides the most explicit definition: “public domain—phrase used to refer to works that are not granted or no longer granted exclusive protection by copyright law” (68b, p. 388). This definition is accurate, but it requires that the reader already knows what “protection by copyright law” means. Further, the definition does not suggest why or when “works . . . are not granted” copyright nor when a work is “no longer granted exclusive protection.” For students to understand the ways that public domain works can contribute to their projects, they need to know much more about the concept and its relationship to other IP concepts.

=== Creative Commons ===

Like resources in the public domain, assets protected by Creative Commons licenses can be a valuable addition to writing projects, particularly as many can be used without obtaining any additional permission. It is critical then that handbooks cover Creative Commons to help students understand the options available to them.

Five of the handbooks—''The McGraw-Hill Handbook,'' the ''St. Martin’s Handbook,'' the ''Little, Brown Handbook,'' ''Keys for Writers,'' and ''Writing Matters''—mention Creative Commons specifically, though with differing levels of detail. The ''McGraw-Hill Handbook'' provides the most details of the five, explaining  Creative Commons in reference to finding images to use in projects:
<blockquote>
The ''Creative Commons'' site (&lt;www.creativecommons.org&gt;) lets you search for material with a Creative Commons license. Such a license specifies the permitted uses of the content. The material shown can be reproduced or altered for noncommercial purposes, as long as it is cited. All the images accompanying ''Wikipedia'' are licensed through ''Creative Commons,'' so that is another source. (17b-2, p. 300)
</blockquote>
An ideal description of Creative Commons would include [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/ all the possible licenses] and explain their requirements in specific detail. For instance, in addition to its noncommercial license, an image may be under an attribution license, which requires identification of the resource’s owner. Perhaps ''McGraw-Hill'' omits these particular details since students must cite all their sources anyway; however, this fact does not account for the failure to explain Creative Commons’ nonderivative and share-alike licensing.

''Keys for Writers'' simply mentions Creative Commons in a passage on evaluating whether an image can be used in a student project:
<blockquote>
Keep in mind, however, that unless the creator of the image has explicitly stated that it is free for noncommercial use (either by a statement on the Web site or by using a Creative Commons license), you should assume that the image is copyrighted and not free for the taking.
</blockquote>
Presumably readers of ''Keys for Writers'' will deduce the definition of Creative Commons as a way to indicate that an image is “free for noncommercial use” from the passage. Unfortunately, that definition is oversimplified, much like that in ''McGraw-Hill,'' given that Creative Commons licenses apply to more than images and include more options than “free for noncommercial use.”

''The St. Martin’s Handbook'' moves beyond images to include sound in its explanation of Creative Commons. The handbook gives readers a short definition in its section on “Creating audio and video projects,” relying on an implicit comparison to licensing options that require permission for use:

<blockquote>
Will you need sound or images from other sources? If so, where can you acquire what you need? If you use the work of others in a project that will be posted for the public, you may need to seek permission from the rightsholders (see Chapter 14). However, critiquing or analyzing someone else’s work in your own project is often considered a “fair use” that does not require permission. You may also want to look for images and sounds distributed under a Creative Commons license, which allows others to use them freely. (18c, p. 290)
</blockquote>
This passage does not fully explain Creative Commons licenses, but it does suggest that the license is a useful option for projects that move beyond word processor-style essays. ''The Little, Brown Handbook'' follows a similar strategy, providing few details and sending students to a librarian for more information:

<blockquote>
To avoid having to seek permission [for  visual, audio, and video sources], you can search Web sites such as Google, Flickr Creative Commons, and Wikimedia Commons for media that are not protected by copyright. On Google, for instance, go to “Search tools” and select “Labeled for reuse.” Consult a librarian at your school if you have questions. (42i, p. 575)
</blockquote>
''Little, Brown'' improves on the ''St. Martin’s Handbook''  by indicating places where students can find Creative Commons resources, but it does not explain the related licenses at all. Further, ''Little, Brown'' includes the incorrect assertion that these “media that are not protected by copyright.” As [https://creativecommons.org/faq/#is-creative-commons-against-copyright the Creative Commons FAQ] explains, “CC licenses are copyright licenses, and depend on the existence of copyright to work. CC licenses are legal tools that creators and other rights holders can use to offer certain usage rights to the public, while reserving other rights.”  Taken literally, students can certainly search out “media that are not protected by copyright”; however, the passage suggests a Creative Commons search will provide that media, which is at best misleading.

While the other four handbooks discuss Creative Commons in the context of using assets created by others, ''Writing Matters'' refers to Creative Commons in its checklist of information writers should include when creating a website. In the chapter on “Writing for Multiple Media,” ''Writing Matters'' tells readers to indicate their preferred IP licensing on the websites they compose:

<blockquote>
'''Copyright or Creative Commons notice.''' All material published on the web is automatically protected by copyright. Remind readers of this fact by including a copyright notice: “Copyright © 2017 Paul Jefferson.” For the copyright date, use the year in which you created or last updated the page. An increasingly popular alternative notice is a Creative Commons License. Browse the Creative Commons website (http://creativecommons.org/) to learn more about this project. (10b, p. 182)
</blockquote>
Note that although copyright is explained, Creative Commons is identified only as an “alternative notice.” For the specific information, students must go elsewhere.

Given that students are following these instructions to create their own websites, they need more information before they can determine how to apply a Creative Commons license to their work. Unfortunately, none of the handbooks reviewed provides an explanation that explores all aspects of a Creative Commons license in a way that would help students choose a license for their own work or interpret the licenses that apply to assets they want incorporate in their projects.

== Gaps in Current Resources ==

The ten handbooks examined provide little to no support for how to provide attribution for sources used in heavily-multimodal composing. All privilege linguistic text sources and text-focused systems of attribution, giving little attention to the needs of writing projects that are not pages, papers, or essays.

In some cases, the information relating to IP concepts in these handbooks is incomplete or misleading. In its chapter “Compose in Online Genres,” ''The Writer’s Handbook'' alludes to copyright in its section on creating podcasts, but the coverage oversimplifies the range of permissions possible:
<blockquote>
'''Know the law:'''
If you use music created by someone else, you likely will have to pay for the right to broadcast that music. If someone agrees to be your guest, you have the right to broadcast that person’s voice. (16b, p 154)

</blockquote>
The passage does allow for other options by stating “you ''likely'' will” (emphasis mine); however, it glosses over the possibility that the “music created by someone else” may be in the public domain, copyright-protected but royalty-free, or available for free use under a Creative Commons license. The statement doesn’t even indicate what law it is the student needs to know. While the admonition to “know the law” is important, failing to consider all the situations the student podcaster may encounter creates a significant gap in the coverage.

Further, the chapter does not include the “know the law” step in the other sections of the chapter. The section on creating web pages states only, “Provide links to sources” (16a, p. 152), with no details on the permissions to consider when incorporating images, audio, or video that the student did not create. Linking to a source is obviously not the same as documenting it and does not in any way correlate with permission for using that source.

''The Writer’s Handbook’s''  section on creating videos specifically suggests that the composer may incorporate the work of others in the ''Plan your content'' step: “Will all the video be original? Will you incorporate other video such as YouTube clips? Will you include still images? Maps or graphs? Music? Voiceover?” (16c, p. 155). Despite this specific reference to borrowed assets, the step-by-step process for creating videos does not mention the significance of knowing the related IP rights and laws nor the importance of citing the borrowed sources.

The ''St. Martin’s Handbook'' jumps from copyright to open source to personal privacy, all in a single section of the textbook:
<blockquote>
'''14f Considering your intellectual property'''<br />

Although you may not have thought too much about it, all of your work in college—including all the research and writing you do, online and off—represents a growing bank of intellectual property. In fact, such original work is automatically copyrighted, even if it lacks the © symbol. But remember that the open source movement is gaining momentum and that sharing your ideas and writing freely with others is a way to perpetuate them and to gain an audience for your views.<br />

For work that you want to protect, here are some tips for making sure that others respect your intellectual property just as you respect theirs:<br />
* Realize that your text and email messages, blog posts and comments, and posts to social networking sites and discussion groups are essentially public. If you don’t want your thoughts and ideas repeated or forwarded, keep them offline. Let recipients know specifically when you do not want your email messages passed on to any third parties. In turn, remember that you should not use material from email, discussion groups, or other online forums without first asking for permission.
* Be careful with your passwords, and use a secure storage method so that only you can give someone access to your work.
* Save all your drafts and notes so that you can show where your work has come from should anyone ask you. (14f, p. 247)
</blockquote>
This passage begins with a brief explanation of students’ own copyright of the works they create. Confusingly, it moves next to the “open source movement,” a term used to describe software licenses. While open source is clearly related to copyright, it is not the best concept to use in this context.  A discussion of Creative Commons licensing would have been more appropriate, since it is the system used to allow less restrictive sharing and collaboration of the kind of projects students create in first-year composition.

Next the passage addresses actions that students can take to protect their intellectual property. Rather than connecting these actions to copyright however, the text seems to blame the victim with warnings about digital security issues. In short, the section brings up complicated issues of the ownership of publicly posted material without exploring the underlying IP rights or discussing how students can enforce their rights.

While there are places the ''St. Martin’s Handbook'' shines, like its discussion of fair use in relation to images (13e, p.237), this section on “Considering your intellectual property” is emblematic of the shortcomings in discussion of IP rights in these handbooks. To fill these gaps in current coverage, writing teachers and students need textbooks or other resources that provide the following:

* Full explanation of Creative Commons, Public Domain, and Fair Use.
* Clear guidelines for attribution and credit of text, images, audio, and video in a range of digital projects (e.g., posters, digital presentations, video).
* Extensive examples of attribution systems in authentic digital projects.
* List of sustainable, reliable sources of digital assets that are appropriate for student projects.
* Details on how to apply one or more of the varying IP licenses to the students’ own work.



= Redesigning Handbooks to Improve IP Rights Coverage =

I conclude by offering suggestions for how to address the oversight in these handbooks so students more fully understand how IP rights as they cite and credit sources.

you can '''not''' plagiarize and still violate copyright.

== Full explanations of all IP concepts, without focusing on scare tactics and blame (see x, y, and z). ==



How are the current resources buying into the issues of the student as cheater and the student as naïve; how is the banking model (ultimately the structural principle for all handbooks) playing into the gaps and misinformation?


== Include Alternative Resources ==

Pull from [http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/ http://faq.tracigardner.com/category/graphics/]

Fair use is a legal concept that describes when it is acceptable to use works protected by copyright. Fair use is determined by four principles, which you can read more about in your textbook:

* '''How will the work be used?''' Is it for commentary, education, research, etc.? Will someone profit financially from it?
* '''What kind of work is it?''' In particular, has it been published?
* '''How much of the work will be used?''' All of it? Most of it? A little of it?
* '''How will the use effect the sales of the original?''' Will people still buy/use the original?

Use the flowchart on [http://thevisualcommunicationguy.com/2014/07/14/can-i-use-that-picture/ Can I Use that Picture? The Terms, Laws, and Ethics for Using Copyrighted Images], from Curtis Newbold, to decide if you your use of a source is fair use.

Use the [http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/ Fair Use Evaluator], from the American Library Association, for a thorough analysis and to write a justification of your use.




== Shift from ''Writing With'' Sources to ''Creating With'' Sources  ==

Ideal coverage of IP rights would extend what we know about teaching students to ''write from'' sources to teaching students to ''create with'' sources.

Need to convince students (the world) that finding is just as valuable as creating .......

What do the handbooks need to do to provide the materials that students need? Can the citation analysis idea be modified from the process for "writing from sources" to the process of "creating WITH sources"?

== New WPA statement ==

Talking About Plagiarism Isn’t Enough: Radical Thoughts on “Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices”

While plagiarism is well-covered in the 2003 statement “Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices,” writing programs today need to do more than cover plagiarism. As we expand the definition of “college writing” to include forms of writing beyond traditional papers, we need to expand our discussion of how these various sources are used and cited as well.

Based on an analysis of the 2003 statement and a survey of current writing handbooks, this presentation identifies gaps in the discussion of ownership and copyright, suggests ways WPAs can address these oversights, and calls for a new WPA statement that covers best practices for defining and respecting intellectual property rights.


=== Treat Error as Error, Not Plagiarism or Copyright Violation ===

The Council of Writing Program Administrators’ ''Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices'' emphasizes that attempts at citation, documentation, and related writing from sources (i.e., quotation, paraphrase, summary) are examples of citation and documentation errors, rather than examples of plagiarism. This same approach can inform the ways that handbooks teach students how to create with sources.

When writing from sources, students are often corrected or suspected ugh --is this a quotation?

LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
Ownership Rights across Cultures
American academic culture takes seriously the ownership of words and text. It respects both the individual as author (and authority) and the originality of the individual’s ideas. In some cultures, memorization and the use of classic texts are common in all walks of life. And worldwide, the ownership of language, texts, music, and videos is being called into question by the democratic, interactive nature of the Internet. In short, therefore, plagiarism is not something universal and easy to define. In American academic culture, basic ground rules exist for the “fair use” of another writer’s work without payment, but easy access to music and media sources poses interesting questions about intellectual property and the opportunities to create and remix culture.

= Conclusion =

The primary domain of these handbooks is the print-ready word-processor document. They sometimes mention student-composed webpages and more rarely discuss student-created projects that result in static images, audio recordings, and video. From this perspective, perhaps the handbook authors and editors do not see it as a practical concern to address issues such as how to add an attribution to a persuasive poster or a documentary video.


== How More Thorough Coverage Addresses Writers’ Needs ==

== Call to Advocate for More Friendly and Complete Models and Instruction ==

Time for an open source guide to citations and attribution that takes the education away from the publishers, who are more invested in copyright ownership than in free and open systems of citation.

Currently available textbooks suffer from the following gaps:

* Inadequate coverage of IP rights as they apply to highly-multimodal compositions that move beyond customary essay-style forms.
* Incomplete discussion of Creative Commons licenses and public domain.
* Failure to outline documentation and citation practices beyond in-text citations, endnotes, and bibliographic references.
* Insufficient explanation of how to apply one or more of the varying IP licenses to the students’ own work.
* Limited examples of citation and attribution practices.
