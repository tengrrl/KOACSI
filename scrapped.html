How are the current resources buying into the issues of the student as cheater and the student as naïve; how is the banking model (ultimately the structural principle for all handbooks) playing into the gaps and misinformation?

Fair use is a legal concept that describes when it is acceptable to use works protected by copyright. Fair use is determined by four principles, which you can read more about in your textbook:

* '''How will the work be used?''' Is it for commentary, education, research, etc.? Will someone profit financially from it?
* '''What kind of work is it?''' In particular, has it been published?
* '''How much of the work will be used?''' All of it? Most of it? A little of it?
* '''How will the use effect the sales of the original?''' Will people still buy/use the original?

Use the [http://librarycopyright.net/resources/fairuse/ Fair Use Evaluator], from the American Library Association, for a thorough analysis and to write a justification of your use.

Talking About Plagiarism Isn’t Enough: Radical Thoughts on “Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices”

While plagiarism is well-covered in the 2003 statement “Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices,” writing programs today need to do more than cover plagiarism. As we expand the definition of “college writing” to include forms of writing beyond traditional papers, we need to expand our discussion of how these various sources are used and cited as well.

Based on an analysis of the 2003 statement and a survey of current writing handbooks, this presentation identifies gaps in the discussion of ownership and copyright, suggests ways WPAs can address these oversights, and calls for a new WPA statement that covers best practices for defining and respecting intellectual property rights.



=== Treat Error as Error, Not Plagiarism or Copyright Violation ===

The Council of Writing Program Administrators’ ''Defining and Avoiding Plagiarism: The WPA Statement on Best Practices'' emphasizes that attempts at citation, documentation, and related writing from sources (i.e., quotation, paraphrase, summary) are examples of citation and documentation errors, rather than examples of plagiarism. This same approach can inform the ways that handbooks teach students how to create with sources.

When writing from sources, students are often corrected or suspected ugh --is this a quotation?

LANGUAGE AND CULTURE
Ownership Rights across Cultures
American academic culture takes seriously the ownership of words and text. It respects both the individual as author (and authority) and the originality of the individual’s ideas. In some cultures, memorization and the use of classic texts are common in all walks of life. And worldwide, the ownership of language, texts, music, and videos is being called into question by the democratic, interactive nature of the Internet. In short, therefore, plagiarism is not something universal and easy to define. In American academic culture, basic ground rules exist for the “fair use” of another writer’s work without payment, but easy access to music and media sources poses interesting questions about intellectual property and the opportunities to create and remix culture.

Currently available textbooks suffer from the following gaps:

* Inadequate coverage of IP rights as they apply to highly-multimodal compositions that move beyond customary essay-style forms.
* Incomplete discussion of Creative Commons licenses and public domain.
* Failure to outline documentation and citation practices beyond in-text citations, endnotes, and bibliographic references.
* Insufficient explanation of how to apply one or more of the varying IP licenses to the students’ own work.
* Limited examples of citation and attribution practices.
